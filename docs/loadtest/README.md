# Loadtest

This version of the load tester can test subscription `v1alpha2` only. For `v1alpha1` we have a [legacy branch](https://github.com/kyma-project/eventing-tools/tree/loadtest-subscription-v1alpha1).
This tool is used to generate continues load on the Eventing components.
It does that by sending CloudEvents to the Eventing publisher proxy forever and consuming them inside Kyma functions.
Ideally, it should be used when JetStream is used as the active Eventing backend.

## Subscriptions

The publisher watches all subscriptions in the cluster.
To activate sending events for one subscription, you must label that subscription with one of the following labels:
- eventing-loadtest: legacy 
- eventing-loadtest: cloudevent

After you configured the event type in the label, the load tester creates events accordingly and sends them with the format configured in the label.

The load generated per event type is extracted from the event type. To do this, the event type must match the following pattern:
`<event-name>.v<Number of events per second>`. For example, `order.created.v500` creates events of type order.create.v500 and the sender tries to publish 500 events per second.

> Note: Encoding the EPS in the event type version is used only for debugging purposes and is not a production use case.

> There is no special handling of subscriptions otherwise. The `sink` and also the `maxInFlight` settings will be respected.

This publisher works best in combination with the loadtest-subscriber. Two instances of the subscriber are deployed using the kustomize deployment. To configure the subscriptions to use those two instances, set the sink to `loadtest-subscriber-0.eventing-test.svc.cluster.local` or `loadtest-subscriber-1.eventing-test.svc.cluster.local`

## Configurations

Command-line arguments for the subscriber:

## Usage

### Deploy

1. Connect to a Kubernetes cluster.
2. Execute:
   ```bash
   make loadtest-deploy
   ```

### Change the loadtest behaviour at runtime:

1. Update the loadtest ConfigMap values:
   ```bash
   kubectl edit cm -n eventing-test loadtest
   ```

   > Note: After updating the loadtest-publisher  ConfigMap, its behaviour will change
   > automatically at runtime without the need to restart it.

### Stop

This is useful in case we want to stop sending events to the Eventing publisher proxy, but preserve the Eventing
infrastructure inside the `eventing-test` namespace.

1. Connect to a Kubernetes cluster.
2. Execute:
   ```bash
   make loadtest-stop
   ```

   > Note: To continue sending events, deploy the loadtest again.

### Logs

1. Connect to a Kubernetes cluster.
2. Loadtest logs:
   ```bash
   stern -n eventing-test loadtest -c loadtest --since 1s
   ```
3. Subscriber logs:
   ```bash
   stern -n eventing-test sink -c function --since 1s | grep type
   ```

### Cleanup

1. Connect to a Kubernetes cluster.
2. Execute:
   ```bash
   make loadtest-delete
   ```

## Future enhancements

- Implement a graceful shutdown to delete Kyma subscriptions in the `eventing-test` Namespace when the loadtest receives a termination signal.
